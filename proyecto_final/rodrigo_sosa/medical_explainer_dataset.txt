[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The substantial winter influenza peak in temperate climates has lead to the hypothesis that cold and/or dry air is a causal factor in influenza variability. We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975–2002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975–2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = −0.61) and severity (r = −0.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019). This research supports the contention that cold, dry air may be related to influenza mortality and suggests that warning systems could provide enough lead time to be effective in mitigating the effects.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Bangladesh is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries for climate change. This observational study examined the association of temperature, humidity and rainfall with six common climate-sensitive infectious diseases in adults (malaria, diarrheal disease, enteric fever, encephalitis, pneumonia and bacterial meningitis) in northeastern Bangladesh. Subjects admitted to the adult medicine ward of a tertiary referral hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012 with a diagnosis of one of the six chosen climate-sensitive infectious diseases were enrolled in the study. Climate-related data were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Institute. Disease incidence was then analyzed against mean temperature, humidity and average rainfall for the Sylhet region. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test and ANOVA testing. 5033 patients were enrolled (58% male, 42% female, ratio 1.3:1). All six diseases showed highly significant (p = 0.01) rises in incidence between the study years 2008 (540 cases) and 2012 (1330 cases), compared with no significant rise in overall all-cause hospital admissions in the same period (p = 0.19). The highest number of malaria (135), diarrhea (266) and pneumonia (371) cases occurred during the rainy season. On the other hand, the maximum number of enteric fever (408), encephalitis (183) and meningitis (151) cases occurred during autumn, which follows the rainy season. A positive (P = 0.01) correlation was observed between increased temperature and the incidence of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea, and a negative correlation with encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia. Higher humidity correlated (P = 0.01) with a higher number of cases of malaria and diarrhea, but inversely correlated with meningitis and encephalitis. Higher incidences of encephalitis and meningitis occurred while there was low rainfall. Incidences of diarrhea, malaria and enteric fever, increased with rainfall, and then gradually decreased. The findings support a relationship between weather patterns and disease incidence, and provide essential baseline data for future large prospective studies.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Few studies have assessed viral contamination in the rooms of hospital wards. This cross-sectional study evaluated the air and objects in patient-occupied rooms in pediatric wards for the presence of common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Air samplers were placed at a short (60–80 cm) and long (320 cm) distance from the head of the beds of 58 pediatric patients, who were subsequently confirmed to be infected with enterovirus (n = 17), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 13), influenza A virus (n = 13), adenovirus (n = 9), or M pneumoniae (n = 6). Swab samples were collected from the surfaces of 5 different types of objects in the patients’ rooms. All air and swab samples were analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the presence of the above pathogens. All pathogens except enterovirus were detected in the air, on the objects, or in both locations in the patients’ rooms. The detection rates of influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae for the long distance air sampling were 15%, 67%, and 17%, respectively. Both adenovirus and M pneumoniae were detected at very high rates, with high concentrations, on all sampled objects. The respiratory pathogens RSV, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae were detected in the air and/or on the objects in the pediatric ward rooms. Appropriate infection control measures should be strictly implemented when caring for such patients.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Children and young adults of reproductive age have emerged as groups that are highly vulnerable to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The sex of an individual is a fundamental factor that can influence exposure, susceptibility and immune responses to influenza. Worldwide, the incidence, disease burden, morbidity and mortality rates following exposure to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus differ between males and females and are often age-dependent. Pregnancy and differences in the presentation of various risk factors contribute to the worse outcome of infection in women. Vaccination and antiviral treatment efficacy also vary in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, sex-specific genetic and hormonal differences may contribute to the severity of influenza and the clearance of viral infection. The contribution of sex and gender to influenza can only be determined by a greater consideration of these factors in clinical and epidemiological studies and increased research into the biological basis underlying these differences.

[PROMPT]: How does asthma affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Children born preterm, less than 37 weeks’ gestation, are at increased risk of viral respiratory infections and associated complications both during their initial birth hospitalisation and in their first years following discharge. This increased burden of viral respiratory infections is likely to have long term implications for lung health and function in individuals born preterm, particularly those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the association between early life viral respiratory infection and development of suboptimal lung health and function later in life following preterm birth. Although preterm infants with diminished lung function, particularly small airways, might be particularly susceptible to asthma and wheezing disorders following viral infection, there is evidence that respiratory viruses can activate number of inflammatory and airway re-modelling pathways. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight the perinatal and early life risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections among preterm infants during early life and to understand how respiratory viral infection may influence the development of abnormal lung health and function later in life.

[PROMPT]: How does asthma affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: RATIONALE: The majority of asthma exacerbations are related to viral respiratory infections. Some, but not all, previous studies have reported that low interferon responses in patients with asthma increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship between lower airway inflammatory biomarkers, specifically interferon gene expression, and the severity or presence of an exacerbation in asthmatics experiencing a naturally occurring viral infection. METHODS: Sputum samples were analyzed from subjects in an asthma exacerbation study who experienced a confirmed viral infection. Subjects were monitored for daily symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until baseline. Sputum samples were assessed for cell counts and gene expression. RESULTS: IFN-γ expression was significantly greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.002). IFN-α1, IFN-β1, and IFN-γ mRNA levels correlated with the peak Asthma Index (r=0.58, p<0.001; r=0.57, p=0.001; and r=0.51, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, IL-13, IL-10 and eosinophil major basic protein mRNA levels were greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.03, p=0.06, and p=0.02, respectively), and IL-13 mRNA correlated with the peak Asthma Index (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that asthma exacerbations are associated with increased rather than decreased expression of interferons early in the course of infection. These findings raise the possibility that excessive virus-induced interferon production during acute infections can contribute to airway inflammation and exacerbations of asthma.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been repeatedly used to rescue patients with cardiopulmonary arrest. However, its clinical utility in endocrine emergencies remains unclear. Herein, we describe a case series of 12 patients presenting with refractory shock secondary to endocrine emergencies who were rescued by ECMO support. Patients were identified between 2005 and 2012 from our ECMO registry. The diagnostic distribution was as follows: pheochromocytoma crisis (n = 4), thyroid storm (n = 5), and diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 3). The initial presentation of pheochromocytoma crisis was indistinguishable from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and frequently accompanied by paroxysmal hypertension and limb ischemia. Thyroid storm was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and severe gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas neurological symptoms were common in diabetic ketoacidosis. The clinical outcomes of patients with endocrine emergencies were compared with those of 80 cases with AMI who received ECMO because of cardiogenic shock. The cardiac function and the general conditions showed a significantly faster recovery in patients with endocrine emergencies than in those with AMI. We conclude that ECMO support can be clinically useful in endocrine emergencies. The screening of endocrine diseases should be considered during the resuscitation of patients with refractory circulatory shock.

[PROMPT]: How does diabetes affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Various pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) axis in community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNFα, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNFα cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNFα and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both controls and HFREF. TNFα, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of symptoms in HFPEF. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation mediated through TNFα and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, may represent an important component of a comorbidity-induced inflammatory response that partially drives the pathophysiology of HFPEF.

[PROMPT]: How does diabetes affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: There is a marked paucity of data concerning AKI in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a substantial burden of trauma and HIV. METHODS: Prospective data was collected on all patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary ICU in South Africa during 2017. Development of AKI (before or during ICU admission) was recorded and renal recovery 90 days after ICU discharge was determined. RESULTS: Of 849 admissions, the mean age was 42.5 years and mean SAPS 3 score was 48.1. Comorbidities included hypertension (30.5%), HIV (32.6%), diabetes (13.3%), CKD (7.8%) and active tuberculosis (6.2%). The most common reason for admission was trauma (26%). AKI developed in 497 (58.5%). Male gender, illness severity, length of stay, vasopressor drugs and sepsis were independently associated with AKI. AKI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 31.8% vs 7.23% in those without AKI. Age, active tuberculosis, higher SAPS 3 score, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support and sepsis were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for death. HIV was not independently associated with AKI or hospital mortality. CKD developed in 14 of 110 (12.7%) patients with stage 3 AKI; none were dialysis-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective multidisciplinary ICU cohort of younger patients, AKI was common, often associated with trauma in addition to traditional risk factors and was associated with good functional renal recovery at 90 days in most survivors. Although the HIV prevalence was high and associated with higher mortality, this was related to the severity of illness and not to HIV status per se.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Growing evidence exists for soluble Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (sACE2) as a biomarker in definitive heart failure (HF), but there is little information about changes in sACE2 activity in hypertension with imminent heart failure and in reverse remodeling. METHODS, FINDINGS: Patients with systolic HF (NYHAII-IV, enrolled for cardiac resynchronisation therapy, CRT, n = 100) were compared to hypertensive patients (n = 239) and to a healthy cohort (n = 45) with preserved ejection fraction (EF>50%) in a single center prospective clinical study. The status of the heart failure patients were checked before and after CRT. Biochemical (ACE and sACE2 activity, ACE concentration) and echocardiographic parameters (EF, left ventricular end-diastolic (EDD) and end-systolic diameter (ESD) and dP/dt) were measured. sACE2 activity negatively correlated with EF and positively with ESD and EDD in all patient's populations, while it was independent in the healthy cohort. sACE2 activity was already increased in the hypertensive group, where signs for imminent heart failure (slightly decreased EF and barely increased NT-proBNP levels) were detected. sACE2 activities further increased in patients with definitive heart failure (EF<50%), while sACE2 activities decreased with the improvement of the heart failure after CRT (reverse remodeling). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were lower in the diseased populations, but did not show a strong correlation with the echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Soluble ACE2 activity appears to be biomarker in heart failure, and in hypertension, where heart failure may be imminent. Our data suggest that sACE2 is involved in the pathomechanism of hypertension and HF.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell-matrix interactions by means of specific adhesion proteins. Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called “invadosomes”. Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease that carries a high mortality. Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patient’s hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/μl, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The current mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is between 45% and 92%, with most dying within the first two weeks of the illness. In an effort to combat such an alarmingly high mortality rate, various treatment therapies such as low tidal volume ventilation strategies, corticosteroid therapy, and use of nitric oxide (NO) have been attempted in the management of patients with ARDS. Three cases which were admitted to the ICU and confirmed to have ARDS were unable to be weaned from ventilatory support, and nitric oxide therapy was initiated. It improved patients' oxygenation for short periods of time but did not affect the mortality. The patients could not be weaned from the ventilator and expired.

[PROMPT]: How does intubation affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: In pediatric cardiac anesthesiology, there is increased focus on minimizing morbidity, ensuring optimal functional status, and using health care resources sparingly. One aspect of care that has potential to affect all of the above is postoperative mechanical ventilation. Historically, postoperative ventilation was considered a must for maintaining patient stability. Ironically, it is recognized that mechanical ventilation may increase risk of adverse outcomes in the postoperative period. Hence, many institutions have advocated for immediate extubation or early extubation after many congenital heart surgeries which was first reported decades ago. METHODS: 637 consecutive patient charts were reviewed for pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were placed into three groups. Those that were extubated in the operating room (OR) at the conclusion of surgery (Immediate Extubation or IE), those that were extubated within six hours of admission to the ICU (Early Extubation or EE) and those that were extubated sometime after six hours (Delayed Extubation or DE). Multiple variables were then recorded to see which factors correlated with successful Immediate or Early Extubation. RESULTS: Overall, 338 patients (53.1%) had IE), 273 (42.8%) had DE while only 26 patients (4.1%) had EE. The median age was 1174 days for the IE patients, 39 days for the DE patients, whereas 194 days for EE patients (p < 0.001). Weight and length were also significantly different in at least one extubation group from the other two (p < 0.001). The median ICU LOS was 3 and 4 days for IE and EE patients respectively, whereas it was 9.5 days for DE patients (p < 0.001). DE group had a significant longer median anesthesia time and cardiopulmonary bypass time than the other two extubation groups (p > 63,826.88 < 0.001). Regional low flow perfusion, deep hypothermia, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, redo sternotomy, use of other sedatives, furosemide, epinephrine, vasopressin, open chest, cardiopulmonary support, pulmonary edema, syndrome, as well as difficult intubation were significantly associated with delayed extubation (IE, EE or DE). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and early extubation was significantly associated with several factors, including patient age and size, duration of CPB, use of certain anesthetic drugs, and the amount of blood loss and blood replacement. IE can be successfully accomplished in a majority of pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, including in a minority of infants.

[PROMPT]: How does diabetes affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Renin angiotensin system (RAS) is known to play a key role in several diseases such as diabetes, and renal and cardiovascular pathologies. Its blockade has been demonstrated to delay chronic kidney disease progression and cardiovascular damage in diabetic patients. In this sense, since local RAS has been described, the aim of this study is to characterize angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 activities, as well as protein expression, in several tissues of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice model. After 21 or 40 days of diabetes onset, mouse serums and tissues were analyzed for ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities and protein expression. ACE and ACE2 enzyme activities were detected in different tissues. Their expressions vary depending on the studied tissue. Thus, whereas ACE activity was highly expressed in lungs, ACE2 activity was highly expressed in pancreas among the studied tissues. Interestingly, we also observed that diabetes up-regulates ACE mainly in serum, lung, heart, and liver, and ACE2 mainly in serum, liver, and pancreas. In conclusion, we found a marked serum and pulmonary alteration in ACE activity of diabetic mice, suggesting a common regulation. The increase of ACE2 activity within the circulation in diabetic mice may be ascribed to a compensatory mechanism of RAS.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma. Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum. It was not found in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. CONCLUSION: HMPV is only found in a very small number of patients with AE-COPD. However it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of AE-COPD because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants of the progression and severity of COPD. The present study explored the correlation between sputum p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MATERIAL/METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from 48 COPD patients and 12 healthy persons. Sputum p38 MAPK activity was measured by Western blotting and sputum levels of CXCL8 and neutrophil, and lung function was measured. The correlation between p38MAPK activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function was analyzed. RESULT: Our results showed the significantly increased expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and CXCL8 in the sputum samples of the COPD patients. The p38 MAPK activity was remarkably correlated with the CXCL8 level and neutrophils infiltration in the airway, and the decline of lung function in the COPD patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the pivotal role of p38 MAPK in the airway inflammation of COPD patients. We propose p38 MAPK as a potential target for the treatment of COPD.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) and severe sepsis (SS) are possible complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of the study was to evaluate prevalence, characteristics, risk factors and impact on mortality of hospitalized patients with CAP according to the presence of ARF and SS on admission. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, prospective study of consecutive CAP patients admitted to three hospitals in Italy, Spain, and Scotland between 2008 and 2010. Three groups of patients were identified: those with neither ARF nor SS (Group A), those with only ARF (Group B) and those with both ARF and SS (Group C) on admission. RESULTS: Among the 2,145 patients enrolled, 45% belonged to Group A, 36% to Group B and 20% to Group C. Patients in Group C were more severe than patients in Group B. Isolated ARF was correlated with age (p < 0.001), COPD (p < 0.001) and multilobar infiltrates (p < 0.001). The contemporary occurrence of ARF and SS was associated with age (p = 0.002), residency in nursing home (p = 0.007), COPD (p < 0.001), multilobar involvement (p < 0.001) and renal disease (p < 0.001). 4.2% of patients in Group A died, 9.3% in Group B and 26% in Group C, p < 0.001. After adjustment, the presence of only ARF had an OR for in-hospital mortality of 1.85 (p = 0.011) and the presence of both ARF and SS had an OR of 6.32 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of ARF and SS on hospital admission can help physicians in classifying CAP patients into three different clinical phenotypes.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: To investigate the status of anti-tuberculosis treatment in critically ill patients, and to explore the value of APACHE-II score in guiding anti-tuberculosis treatment. METHODS: This analysis included critically ill patients with tuberculosis. The utility of APACHE-II score for predicting drug withdrawal was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 320 patients enrolled (58 ± 22 years; 256 males), 147 (45.9%) had drugs withdrawn. The drug withdrawal group had higher APACHE-II score (median [interquartile range]: 21 [3–52] vs. 17 [4–42] points), higher CD4%, lower hemoglobin level, higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic renal failure, and lower rate of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (P < 0.05). Logistic regression identified APACHE-II score > 18 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.099 [1.321–3.334], P < 0.01), COPD (1.913 [1.028–3.561], P < 0.05) and hemoglobin level (0.987 [0.977–0.997], P < 0.05) as independent factors associated with drug withdrawal. At an optimal cutoff of 18.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of APACHE-II score for predicting drug withdrawal was 59.2, 61.8, 56.9 and 64.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: APACHE-II score > 18 points might predict patient tolerance of anti-tuberculosis treatment.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Viral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. METHODS: The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients. H. influenzae was observed in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients. CONCLUSION: Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Medical advances have failed to arrest the growing morbidity and mortality from lung diseases. COPD, lung cancer and pulmonary infections remain leading causes of death. More than any other time in human history, we need high quality, translatable, patient-focussed respiratory research that will improve clinical practice. Close teamwork of scientists and clinicians are essential. The results of these work need to be disseminated quickly and widely. The creation of an open access journal, such as Translational Respiratory Medicine, dedicated to translational respiratory research can help foster progress.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Patients with frequent exacerbations represent a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subgroup requiring better treatment options. The aim of this study was to determine the innate immune mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to frequent exacerbations in COPD. We measured sputum expression of immune mediators and bacterial loads in samples from patients with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbations. In vitro immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (≥2 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (<2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the antiviral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. A role for epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune dysregulation was identified: induction of interferons and ISGs during in vitro rhinovirus (RV) infection was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators additionally had increased sputum bacterial loads at 2 wk following virus-associated exacerbation onset. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving epithelial cells in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD. Therapeutic approaches to boost innate antimicrobial immunity in the lung could be a viable strategy for prevention and treatment of frequent exacerbations.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial. METHODS: Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to identify the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with COPD exacerbations. The bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. The peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. RESULTS: Viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of the 72 patients enrolled. The most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza A, and rhinovirus. A total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. The WBC, CRP, and PCT levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the COPD exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year period following the first exacerbation. CONCLUSION: WBC, CRP, or PCT could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring ED visits. Those with increased sputum during a COPD exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The noble gas helium has many applications owing to its distinct physical and chemical characteristics, namely: its low density, low solubility, and high thermal conductivity. Chiefly, the abundance of studies in medicine relating to helium are concentrated in its possibility of being used as an adjunct therapy in a number of respiratory ailments such as asthma exacerbation, COPD, ARDS, croup, and bronchiolitis. Helium gas, once believed to be biologically inert, has been recently shown to be beneficial in protecting the myocardium from ischemia by various mechanisms. Though neuroprotection of brain tissue has been documented, the mechanism by which it does so has yet to be made clear. Surgeons are exploring using helium instead of carbon dioxide to insufflate the abdomen of patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal procedures due to its superiority in preventing respiratory acidosis in patients with comorbid conditions that cause carbon dioxide retention. Newly discovered applications in Pulmonary MRI radiology and imaging of organs in very fine detail using Helium Ion Microscopy has opened exciting new possibilities for the use of helium gas in technologically advanced fields of medicine.

[PROMPT]: How does COPD affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Bronchial epithelial cells are the first target cell for rhinovirus infection. The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins β-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: With the advent of antiretroviral therapy that can control virus replication below the detection levels of conventional assays, a new clinical landscape of AIDS emerged, in which non-AIDS complications prevail over AIDS-defining conditions. These comorbidities are diverse and affect multiple organs, thus resulting in cardiovascular, kidney, neurocognitive and liver disease, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and cancers. A common feature of these conditions is that they are generally associated with accelerated aging. The mechanism behind these comorbidities is chronic excessive inflammation induced by HIV infection, which persists under antiretroviral therapy. Progressive simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) closely reproduces these comorbidities and offers a simplified system in which most of the traditional human risk factors for comorbidities (i.e., smoking, hyperlipidemia) are absent. Additionally, experimental conditions can be properly controlled during a shorter course of disease for SIV infection. As such, NHPs can be employed to characterize new paradigms of AIDS pathogenesis and to test the efficacy of interventions aimed at alleviating non-AIDS-related comorbidities.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Viral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. METHODS: The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. RESULTS: Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation inpatients. H. influenzae was observed in stable asthmatic patients. Other bacteria, especially S. pneumoniae, were important in asthma exacerbation inpatients. CONCLUSION: Viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. Infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The relative bioavailability of nicotine from a nasal spray was assessed in 15 smokers suffering a common cold and rhinitis according to generally accepted criteria. The patients were given a single dose of 2 mg nicotine from the nasal spray with and without concurrent administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor decongestant, xylometazoline, in randomised order. Control session measurements were made in the disease-free state. Applying strict bioequivalence criteria, we found that common cold/rhinitis slightly reduced the bioavailability of nicotine, both in its rate and extent; the geometric mean of the ratio of C(max), AUC and t(max) were 0.81, 0.93 and 1.36, respectively. The nasal vasoconstrictor, xylometazoline, normalised the extent of the bioavailability of nicotine, but further prolonged the time for absorption to almost twice that measured in the disease-free state, increasing the t(max) ratio to 1.72. The results suggest that a minor proportion of people stopping smoking with the help of a nicotine nasal spray may experience a minor reduction in the effect of the spray during common cold/rhinitis. However, the nicotine self-titration behaviour found with most smoking cessation products (except the nicotine patch) will automatically lead to an adjustment of the dosage to achieve the desired effect.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≤100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of >1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression. Conclusions. Host and transplant related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl(-) + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI(sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.

[PROMPT]: How does diabetes affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Various pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) axis in community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNFα, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNFα cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNFα and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both controls and HFREF. TNFα, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of symptoms in HFPEF. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation mediated through TNFα and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, may represent an important component of a comorbidity-induced inflammatory response that partially drives the pathophysiology of HFPEF.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Millions are exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) every year, but not all acquire the virus, suggesting a potential role for host genetics in the moderation of HIV-1 acquisition. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28–42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV–1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.

[PROMPT]: How does diabetes affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016–March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22–33)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16–28), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06–3.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06–0.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04–5.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05–1.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The current mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is between 45% and 92%, with most dying within the first two weeks of the illness. In an effort to combat such an alarmingly high mortality rate, various treatment therapies such as low tidal volume ventilation strategies, corticosteroid therapy, and use of nitric oxide (NO) have been attempted in the management of patients with ARDS. Three cases which were admitted to the ICU and confirmed to have ARDS were unable to be weaned from ventilatory support, and nitric oxide therapy was initiated. It improved patients' oxygenation for short periods of time but did not affect the mortality. The patients could not be weaned from the ventilator and expired.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is not proven to be effective in treating respiratory failure in severe pneumonia. However, some clinicians nevertheless attempt NIV to indirectly deliver adequate oxygenation and avoid unnecessary endotracheal intubation. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we report the case of a 24-year-old woman at 32 weeks' gestation who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She was successfully managed by NIV. DISCUSSION: However, NIV must be managed by providers who are trained in mechanical ventilation. This is of the utmost importance in avoiding any delay should the patient's condition worsen and require endotracheal intubation. Moreover, in pregnant women, the severity of illness may progress quickly due to the immunosuppression inherent in these patients. CONCLUSION: Special attention should be given to the choices of invasive ventilation and NIV to manage community acquired pneumonia patients in third trimester.

[PROMPT]: How does obesity affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Most people exposed to a new flu virus do not notice any symptoms. A small minority develops critical illness. Some of this extremely broad variation in susceptibility is explained by the size of the initial inoculum or the influenza exposure history of the individual; some is explained by generic host factors, such as frailty, that decrease resilience following any systemic insult. Some demographic factors (pregnancy, obesity, and advanced age) appear to confer a more specific susceptibility to severe illness following infection with influenza viruses. As with other infectious diseases, a substantial component of susceptibility is determined by host genetics. Several genetic susceptibility variants have now been reported with varying levels of evidence. Susceptible hosts may have impaired intracellular controls of viral replication (e.g. IFITM3, TMPRS22 variants), defective interferon responses (e.g. GLDC, IRF7/9 variants), or defects in cell-mediated immunity with increased baseline levels of systemic inflammation (obesity, pregnancy, advanced age). These mechanisms may explain the prolonged viral replication reported in critically ill patients with influenza: patients with life-threatening disease are, by definition, abnormal hosts. Understanding these molecular mechanisms of susceptibility may in the future enable the design of host-directed therapies to promote resilience.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The discovery of the NET network (neutrophil extracellular trap) has revolutionized the perception of defense mechanisms used by neutrophils in infections and non-infectious states, as this mechanism proves the complexity of the ways in which neutrophils can act in the organism. The paper describes the NET network and its participation in bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections, both in a positive and a negative aspect. In addition, attention was paid to the participation of NETs in the course of autoimmune diseases, cancer, as well as its impact on pregnancy and fertility in mammals.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: The importance of systemic infections in pregnancy is often underestimated. This is primarily due to the fact that pregnant women, in the majority of cases, do not notice any complaints or only have unspecific flu-like symptoms (e.g. toxoplasmosis). Serological screening within the framework of German maternity care is often insufficient to diagnose existing or emerging infections in time. However, the long-term consequences for the affected children and their parents can be immense. A serological TORCH analysis should be performed if a pregnant woman complains about any typical or unspecific symptoms on suspicion of an infection.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Pregnancy has been associated with severe influenza, an association highlighted during the 2009 pandemic of influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) infection. To assess the underlying mechanism, we infected pregnant and non-pregnant ferrets with A(H1N1) pdm09 virus. A(H1N1)pdm09-infected pregnant ferrets also had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines in their pulmonary tracts. Systemically, total CD8(+) T cell counts and A(H1N1)pdm09-specific B-cell responses in blood were significantly lower in pregnant ferrets. This model predicts that the poorer outcome for pregnant women during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic was due to an elevated level of viral replication and to a cytokine imbalance that led to a less effective immune response.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Critical illness is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication of pregnancy. The majority of pregnancy-related critical care admissions occur postpartum. Antenatally, the pregnant patient is more likely to be admitted with diseases non-specific to pregnancy, such as pneumonia. Pregnancy-specific diseases resulting in ICU admission include obstetric hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, amniotic fluid embolus syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Alternatively, critical illness may result from pregnancy-induced worsening of pre-existing diseases (for example, valvular heart disease, myasthenia gravis, and kidney disease). Pregnancy can also predispose women to diseases seen in the non-pregnant population, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (for example, pneumonia and aspiration), sepsis (for example, chorioamnionitis and pyelonephritis) or pulmonary embolism. The pregnant patient may also develop conditions co-incidental to pregnancy such as trauma or appendicitis. Hemorrhage, particularly postpartum, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain the most frequent indications for ICU admission. This review focuses on pregnancy-specific causes of critical illness. Management of the critically ill mother poses special challenges. The physiologic changes in pregnancy and the presence of a second, dependent, patient may necessitate adjustments to therapeutic and supportive strategies. The fetus is generally robust despite maternal illness, and therapeutically what is good for the mother is generally good for the fetus. For pregnancy-induced critical illnesses, delivery of the fetus helps resolve the disease process. Prognosis following pregnancy-related critical illness is generally better than for age-matched non-pregnant critically ill patients.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Pneumonia during pregnancy has been proven to be associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The management of severe pneumonia in gravid patients is even more challenging. Thus, we summarized the characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of these patients and explored the probable risk factors and predictive factors for pneumonia during pregnancy and the appropriate timing of delivery in severe pneumonia patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 12 patients who were diagnosed with severe pneumonia complicating pregnancy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2010 and June 2017. The clinical features, treatment strategies, and pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records and telephone calls. RESULTS: All 12 patients were in their late second or third trimester. The patients had a higher prevalence of anemia (50%) and preeclampsia (25%) than ordinary pregnant women. Delayed diagnoses were not uncommon. Two mothers died in our series, resulting in a mortality rate of 17%. Two intrauterine deaths were observed. Elective delivery was not performed in any of the four patients in their second trimester. Six of the seven patients who presented after 28 weeks of gestation and had live fetuses underwent emergency deliveries. Preterm births (6/7) and cesarean sections (5/7) were the two leading adverse outcomes in newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia, advanced gestational age, and preeclampsia might be associated with the severity of pneumonia. Chest radiographs should be taken as soon as pneumonia is highly suspected to facilitate an early diagnosis. High incidences of adverse fetal outcomes were observed; thus, termination of the pregnancy is recommended for patients in their third trimester when respiratory function deteriorates progressively. However, it might be reasonable to continue pregnancy for those in their first or second trimester.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Infection with Toxocara may affect the central nervous system. A high seroprevalence of Toxocara infection has been reported in psychiatric patients. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report about an association of Toxocara infection with suicide attempts. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Toxocara exposure is associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric patients. We studied 282 psychiatric outpatients (156 with suicide attempts and 126 without suicide attempts). Sera of patients were analyzed for the presence of anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. One of the 156 (0.6%) suicide attempters and 1 (0.8%) of the 126 controls were positive for anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.04–13.02; P = 1.00). Toxocara seropositivity was significantly higher (P = 0.01) in male patients with consumption of raw dried goat meat than male patients without this consumption. Results suggest that Toxocara exposure is not associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric outpatients in Durango City, Mexico. However, further studies with larger samples sizes to confirm our results should be conducted. Too few patients were seropositive to assess further associations of Toxocara exposure with sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of the psychiatric patients.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Evidence is rapidly accumulating implicating gut dysbiosis in hypertension (HTN). However, we are far from understanding whether this is a cause or consequence of HTN, and how to best translate this fundamental knowledge to advance the management of HTN. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the field, illustrate the connections between the gut and hypertension, and establish that the gut microbiota (GM)-gut interaction is centrally positioned for consideration as an innovative approach for HTN therapeutics. RECENT FINDINGS: Animal models of HTN have shown that gut pathology occurs in HTN, and provides some clues to mechanisms linking the dysbiosis, gut pathology, and HTN. SUMMARY: Circumstantial evidence links gut dysbiosis and HTN. Gut pathology, apparent in animal HTN models, has not been fully investigated in hypertensive patients. Objective evidence and an understanding of mechanisms could have a major impact for new antihypertensive therapies and/or improved applications of current ones.

[PROMPT]: How does intubation affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: The FOLFOX regimen, i.e., folinic acid (FOL), fluorouracil (F) and oxaliplatin (OX), is a drug cocktail that is used to treat gastric and colorectal cancers. Despite the concomitant improvements in response rate, duration of response and patient survival, reports of serious toxic pulmonary side effects have progressively emerged. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient who was treated with FOLFOX as an adjuvant to a rectosigmoidal resection of a rectosigmoidal carcinoma and who developed respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and open lung biopsy findings were compatible with interstitial pneumonia (IP). She received multimodal combination treatment (acetylcysteine, corticosteroids, immune globulins and cyclophosphamide) and survived. We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed all 45 reported cases of FOLFOX-related lung toxicity and/or pulmonary fibrosis for their clinical characteristics and their outcomes related to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We found that for the 45 cases with available data, the median age was 70 years, and the male–female ratio was 3.5: 1. In the patients exhibiting only mild respiratory symptoms, discontinuation of the culprit drug (oxaliplatin) resulted in a 100% regression of the symptoms. However the prognosis of the respiratory insufficient patient proved to be grim: death occurred in 76.9% of the cases despite conventional treatment with corticosteroids. We therefore urge oncologists and critical care specialists not to limit their interventions to the discontinuation of chemotherapy, artificial ventilation, corticosteroids and glutathione replenishment and to consider the gradual introduction of additional immune-modulating agents whenever life-threatening respiratory symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients do not subside; all the more so considering the fact that our analysis showed that every patient who survived intubation and mechanical ventilation experienced a full clinical recovery.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Under a traditional paradigm, only those with the expected background knowledge consume academic literature. The lay press, as well as government and non-government agencies, play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing. The need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change. Yet, public trust in media outlets is at a historic low. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance. However, no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013–2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. This study compared the EVD information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed-methods analysis. These findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the EVD outbreak, perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions. This finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature, nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia, combined with the demands of today’s fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Despite advances in critical care facilities and ventilation therapies acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality rates. The condition can stem from a multitude of causes including pneumonia, septicemia and trauma ultimately resulting in ARDS. ARDS is characterized by respiratory insufficiency with severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia. The treatment strategy depends on the knowledge of the underlying disease. But lung-protective ventilation with adjusted positive end-expiratory pressure remains the most effective therapeutic tool despite advances in prone positioning, inhalation of nitric oxide and the use of steroids. Newer modalities including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (PECLA) are being increasingly introduced in critical care settings as rescue therapies in patients who fail to respond to conservative measures. We describe here the introduction and advances of both ECMO and PECLA in the management of ARDS.

CASE REPORT: A 25 year old male with no significant past medical history had been admitted to a local hospital due to dyspnea and fever. His pulmonary function subsequently failed necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) and introduction of ECMO support. The patient was transported for 300 km by road on ECMO to a tertiary medical center. The diagnosis of ARDS, HIV infection and MDR bacterial and fungal VAP was made. Patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), anti-infective agents and 58 days of veno-venous ECMO support, with complete resolution of the respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: HIV infected patients with ARDS and MDR bacterial VAP whose HIV replication is controlled by ART could be successfully managed with ECMO.

[PROMPT]: How does hypertension affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been repeatedly used to rescue patients with cardiopulmonary arrest. However, its clinical utility in endocrine emergencies remains unclear. Herein, we describe a case series of 12 patients presenting with refractory shock secondary to endocrine emergencies who were rescued by ECMO support. Patients were identified between 2005 and 2012 from our ECMO registry. The diagnostic distribution was as follows: pheochromocytoma crisis (n = 4), thyroid storm (n = 5), and diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 3). The initial presentation of pheochromocytoma crisis was indistinguishable from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and frequently accompanied by paroxysmal hypertension and limb ischemia. Thyroid storm was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and severe gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas neurological symptoms were common in diabetic ketoacidosis. The clinical outcomes of patients with endocrine emergencies were compared with those of 80 cases with AMI who received ECMO because of cardiogenic shock. The cardiac function and the general conditions showed a significantly faster recovery in patients with endocrine emergencies than in those with AMI. We conclude that ECMO support can be clinically useful in endocrine emergencies. The screening of endocrine diseases should be considered during the resuscitation of patients with refractory circulatory shock.

[PROMPT]: How does pregnancy affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Digital health programs, which encompass the subsectors of health information technology, mobile health, electronic health, telehealth, and telemedicine, have the potential to generate “big data.” OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to evaluate two digital health programs in India—the maternal mobile messaging service (Kilkari) and the mobile training resource for frontline health workers (Mobile Academy). We illustrate possible applications of machine learning for public health practitioners that can be applied to generate evidence on program effectiveness and improve implementation. Kilkari is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age–appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one year old. Mobile Academy is an Interactive Voice Response audio training course for accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in India. METHODS: Study participants include pregnant and postpartum women (Kilkari) as well as frontline health workers (Mobile Academy) across 13 states in India. Data elements are drawn from system-generated databases used in the routine implementation of programs to provide users with health information. We explain the structure and elements of the extracted data and the proposed process for their linkage. We then outline the various steps to be undertaken to evaluate and select final algorithms for identifying gaps in data quality, poor user performance, predictors for call receipt, user listening levels, and linkages between early listening and continued engagement. RESULTS: The project has obtained the necessary approvals for the use of data in accordance with global standards for handling personal data. The results are expected to be published in August/September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous evaluations of digital health programs are limited, and few have included applications of machine learning. By describing the steps to be undertaken in the application of machine learning approaches to the analysis of routine system-generated data, we aim to demystify the use of machine learning not only in evaluating digital health education programs but in improving their performance. Where articles on analysis offer an explanation of the final model selected, here we aim to emphasize the process, thereby illustrating to program implementors and evaluators with limited exposure to machine learning its relevance and potential use within the context of broader program implementation and evaluation.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires urgent and specific antimicrobial therapy. However, the causal pathogen is typically unknown at the point when anti-infective therapeutics must be initiated. Physicians synthesize information from diverse data streams to make appropriate decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at finding complex relationships in large volumes of data. We aimed to evaluate the abilities of experienced physicians and AI to answer this question at patient admission: is it a viral or a bacterial pneumonia? METHODS: We included patients hospitalized for CAP and recorded all data available in the first 3-h period of care (clinical, biological and radiological information). For this proof-of-concept investigation, we decided to study only CAP caused by a singular and identified pathogen. We built a machine learning model prediction using all collected data. Finally, an independent validation set of samples was used to test the pathogen prediction performance of: (i) a panel of three experts and (ii) the AI algorithm. Both were blinded regarding the final microbial diagnosis. Positive likelihood ratio (LR) values > 10 and negative LR values < 0.1 were considered clinically relevant. RESULTS: We included 153 patients with CAP (70.6% men; 62 [51–73] years old; mean SAPSII, 37 [27–47]), 37% had viral pneumonia, 24% had bacterial pneumonia, 20% had a co-infection and 19% had no identified respiratory pathogen. We performed the analysis on 93 patients as co-pathogen and no-pathogen cases were excluded. The discriminant abilities of the AI approach were low to moderate (LR+ = 2.12 for viral and 6.29 for bacterial pneumonia), and the discriminant abilities of the experts were very low to low (LR+ = 3.81 for viral and 1.89 for bacterial pneumonia). CONCLUSION: Neither experts nor an AI algorithm can predict the microbial etiology of CAP within the first hours of hospitalization when there is an urgent need to define the anti-infective therapeutic strategy.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious respiratory disorder for which therapy is primarily supportive once infection is excluded. Surgical lung biopsy may rule out other diagnoses, but has not been generally useful for therapy decisions or prognosis in this setting. Importantly, tissue and peripheral blood eosinophilia, the hallmarks of steroid-responsive acute eosinophilic pneumonia, are not commonly linked with ALI. We hypothesized that occult eosinophilic pneumonia may explain better outcomes for some patients with ALI. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using a novel monoclonal antibody recognizing eosinophil peroxidase (EPX-mAb) was used to assess intrapulmonary eosinophil accumulation/degranulation. Lung biopsies from ALI patients (n = 20) were identified following review of a pathology database; 45% of which (i.e., 9/20) displayed classical diffuse alveolar damage (ALI-DAD). Controls were obtained from uninvolved tissue in patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer (n = 10). Serial biopsy sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry provided a >40-fold increased sensitivity to detect eosinophils in the lung relative to H&E stained sections. This increased sensitivity led to the identification of higher numbers of eosinophils in ALI patients compared with controls; differences using H&E staining alone were not significant. Clinical assessments showed that lung infiltrating eosinophil numbers were higher in ALI patients that survived hospitalization compared with non-survivors. A similar conclusion was reached quantifying eosinophil degranulation in each biopsy. CONCLUSION: The enhanced sensitivity of EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry uniquely identified eosinophil accumulation/degranulation in patients with ALI relative to controls. More importantly, this method was a prognostic indicator of patient survival. These observations suggest that EPX-mAb immunohistochemistry may represent a diagnostic biomarker identifying a subset of ALI patients with improved clinical outcomes.

[PROMPT]: How does smoking affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl(-) + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI(sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: Because of the absence of well-standardized both in-house and FDA-approved commercially available diagnostic tests, the reliable diagnosis of respiratory infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae remains difficult. In addition, no formal external quality assessment schemes which would allow to conclude about the performance of M. pneumoniae diagnostic tests exist. In this review, the current state of knowledge of M. pneumoniae-associated respiratory infections in the context of epidemiological studies published during the past 5 years is discussed, with particular emphasis on the diagnostic strategies used and their impact on results. The role of M. pneumoniae as a cause of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) differs from study to study due to geographical and epidemiological differences, as well as to the application of different diagnostic techniques and criteria used.

[PROMPT]: How does pneumonia affect COVID-19 patients?
[EXPLANATION]: BACKGROUND: Since the Sepsis-3 criteria, change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score has become a key component of sepsis identification. Thus, it could be argued that reversal of this change (Δ(SOFA)) may reflect sepsis response and could be used as measure of efficacy in interventional trials. We aimed to assess the predictive performance of Δ(SOFA) for 28-day mortality. METHODS: Data from two previously published randomized controlled trials were studied: the first reporting on patients with severe Gram-negative infections as a derivation cohort and the second reporting on patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia as a validation cohort. Only patients with sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 definition were included in this analysis. SOFA scores were calculated on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28. RESULTS: We included 448 patients within the derivation cohort and 199 within the validation cohort. Mean SOFA scores on day 1 were 6.06 ± 4.07 and 7.84 ± 3.39, and 28 day mortality 22.8% and 29.6%, respectively. In the derivation cohort, the earliest time point where Δ(SOFA) score predicted mortality was day 7 (AUROC (95% CI) 0.84 (0.80–0.89); p < 0.001). The best tradeoff for prediction was found with 25% changes (78% sensitivity, 80% specificity); less than 25% decrease of admission SOFA was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio for death 14.87). This finding was confirmed in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Δ(SOFA) on day 7 is a useful early prognostic marker of 28-day mortality and could serve as an endpoint in future sepsis trials alongside mortality.
