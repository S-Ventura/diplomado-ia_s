[RECOMMENDATION]: Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.
Please continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water.

Great question. Yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with COVID-19.
Good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered.

People with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak.
For one specific person... well, there's no way to guess. "People" in general do worse if they have UNcontrolled lung disease. That means it's likely that asthmatics using inhaled steroids to give them good disease control will be BETTER OFF than asthmatics who use steroids but still cannot get good control. Be in good control.

 Pneumonia can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this can cause similar kind of pain. So in my opinion, you should first get the chest X-ray done. If the chest X-ray is worsening, then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics. But if the chest X-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on the affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. Take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is less likely to cause nose bleeding. Recurrent nose bleeding with coughing are commonly seen with sinusitis. So better to consult ENT doctor and get done clinical examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses (PNS). Also get done chest x ray for pneumonia. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia. You may also need endoscopic evaluation of sinuses if CT PNS is suggestive of infection or erosion.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Since you are taking warfarin (blood thinner), possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) related pain is less likely.Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest and back. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside. You will mostly improve with all these in 2-3 days. If not improving then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. Is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? If so, then I would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. Infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. Ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. If she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then I would suggest urgent medical evaluation. I hope she feels better.

For diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.With normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. Cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge

[RECOMMENDATION]: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Pneumonia usually takes 2-3 weeks for complete recovery.Your oxygen requirement is decreasing. This is suggestive of recovery. So you will definitely be alright after 4 weeks. So get done repeat chest x ray to see how much pneumonia is recovered.Chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry are vital to achieve good lung functions after pneumonia.Don't worry, you will be alright.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Hello Gigi !Coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs Medical attention . Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.

Are you having a dry cough or produce phlegm ? what's the colour of the phlegm ? last time you had pneumonia was it properly n completely treated ? Apart from cough what are your other complaints at present ? your cough can be due to inflammation of your throat lining or it can be something to do with your lungs like previous time.  Kindly get your checked by a physician with an open mind and go for a Chest X ray if necessary.

Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. So you should stop amoxicillin. There are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. And left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung.

And both of these them are common after upper respiratory tract infection (URTI - sinusitis). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for pneumonia. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment for bronchitis. So first diagnose android then start appropriate treatment.. Hope I have solved your query.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.

That means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of NOT dying. (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

[RECOMMENDATION]: Covid 19 testing . Hi at the moment it is only recommended that you test for COVID 19 if you have a close contact that has tested positive for the virus or have had recent international travel in the last 14 days. If your symptoms are worsening or your asthma is uncontrolled  you should call your GP rooms or attend your nearest emergency room.

[RECOMMENDATION]: Might be more severe. People with diabetes can have more fragile immune systems with difficulty fighting infections, so if you contract coronavirus you might be at greater risk for breathing complications.  Any serious illness can affect blood sugar control in diabetics also. I recommend taking extra precautions to minimize contact with people so as to avoid contacting the virus.  .

[PROMPT]: Provide a COVID-19-specific health recommendation.
[RECOMMENDATION]: In brief:   Concern   Diabetes if controlled well typically should not be an issue.   I realize there are some conflicting information, but I think the evidence shows that if diabetes controled your immune system still reacts appropriately and not an issue. Arrythmia in itself not and issue. Your age is 60 and that starts to be category of concern with 3% mortality rate.  If you do not smoke that is the key.

[PROMPT]: Provide a COVID-19-specific health recommendation.
[RECOMMENDATION]: Get meds refilled. With the COVID-19 pandemic, people with chronic conditions or even intermittent conditions should get their meds refilled in case pharmacy services close down. For asthma patients, they should refill their inhalers. Some use only an urgent "rescue" inhaler like albuterol, while others also use "preventive" inhalers like fluticasone. It's best to keep both on hand. If symptoms go bad, it's ER time.

Best option is for your wife to discuss this with her employer and take precautions. Good luck!
